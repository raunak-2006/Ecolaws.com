    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) is a federal law in the India that governs the disposal of solid and hazardous waste. It was enacted in 1976 to address the increasing problems from the nation's growing volume of municipal and industrial waste.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="importance">
    <h2>Importance</h2>
    <p>RCRA gives the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to control hazardous waste from its creation to disposal. This includes generation, transportation, treatment, storage, and disposal. The law ensures proper management of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and sets the framework for the proper handling of solid waste.</p>

    <h2>Rules made By Indian government</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><h2>1.Environment Protection Act, 1986<h2></h2></li>
      <p><b>Objective:</b>Under this act, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) has enacted various rules for the management of waste, including hazardous and solid waste.</p>
      <p>This is an umbrella act that provides the framework for the regulation of the environment in India. It empowers the central government to take measures for the protection and improvement of the environment, including the management of hazardous substances.</p>
      <li><h2>2.Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016</h2></li>
      <p><b>Objective:</b> These rules govern the management of hazardous waste in India, including its generation, handling, storage, and disposal.Similar to RCRA's "cradle-to-grave" regulation of hazardous waste in the U.S., these rules ensure that hazardous waste is managed in an environmentally sound manner throughout its lifecycle.</p>

      <li><h2>3.Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016</h2></li>
      <p><b>Objective:</b>These rules provide guidelines for the management of solid waste, including municipal solid waste.Mandatory segregation of waste at source into biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and domestic hazardous waste.
      Urban local bodies (ULBs) are responsible for the collection, segregation, and disposal of municipal waste.
      Promotion of composting, waste-to-energy plants, and sanitary landfills.<br>
    These rules aim to promote better management and recycling of solid waste, akin to the non-hazardous waste management provisions under RCRA.</p>
    <li><h2>4.Plastic Waste Management Rules, 2016 (Amended 2022)</h2></li>
    <p><b>Objective:</b>These rules regulate the use, disposal, and recycling of plastic waste.Ban on specific single-use plastics.
        Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) for producers, importers, and brand owners to manage plastic waste.
        Provisions for phasing out of plastic bags and promoting alternatives.
        Plastic waste management is an integral part of resource conservation, promoting recycling and reduction of plastic waste.</p>
    <li><h2>5.E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 (Amended 2023)</h2></li>
    <p><b>Objective:</b>These rules regulate the disposal and management of electronic waste (e-waste).
        EPR is mandated for producers of electronic goods.
        Proper disposal and recycling mechanisms for e-waste are to be implemented.
        Targets set for collection and recycling of e-waste by producers.
       The rules are aimed at ensuring the safe and effective disposal of e-waste, which contains hazardous substances like lead and mercury.</p>
       <li><h2>6.Bio-Medical Waste Management Rules, 2016</h2></li>
       <p><b>Objective:</b>These rules govern the disposal of biomedical waste, such as waste generated from hospitals, clinics, and other healthcare facilities.
       Segregation of biomedical waste at source is mandatory.
        Treatment and disposal in accordance with the rules to prevent environmental contamination.
        Facilities generating biomedical waste are required to get authorization from the SPCBs.
        Biomedical waste, if not handled properly, can pose serious health and environmental risks, making this law critical for safe disposal.</p>
        <li><h2>7.Construction and Demolition Waste Management Rules, 2016</h2></li>
        <p><b>Objective:</b>These rules deal with the management of waste generated from construction and demolition activities.
            Construction and demolition waste should be segregated and stored separately.
            Cities must set up facilities to recycle and reuse construction waste.
            These rules promote the recycling of construction debris, reducing the environmental impact of construction activities.</p>
            <li><h2>8. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act, 2010</h2></li>
            <p><b>Objective:</b>This act establishes a special tribunal to handle environmental cases, including those related to waste management and environmental conservation.
             provides for the expeditious disposal of cases related to environmental protection and conservation.
            The NGT ensures that violators of environmental regulations are held accountable.
            The NGT is crucial in enforcing compliance with waste management rules and ensuring environmental justice.</p>

    
    </ul>

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act is an essential piece of legislation for protecting human health and the environment by ensuring that waste is managed in a responsible and sustainable way. It continues to play a critical role in waste management practices in the United States.</p>
