        <h2>Laws made by Indian Goverment</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>1. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974</h2></li>
             <b></b>Objective: The main objective of the Water Act is to prevent and control water pollution, maintain or restore the wholesomeness of water, and establish pollution control boards to monitor pollution levels.
Key Provisions:
Establishment of Pollution Control Boards: The act led to the creation of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) at the national level and State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) in every state. These bodies are responsible for setting water quality standards, regulating industrial discharges, and monitoring water pollution.
Prohibition on Discharging Pollutants: Industries and other entities are prohibited from discharging pollutants into water bodies beyond the permissible limits set by the Pollution Control Boards.
Consent to Establish/Operate: Industrial plants and processes that are likely to discharge sewage or effluents must obtain prior permission (called "consent") from the State Pollution Control Boards before establishing or operating.
Monitoring and Penalties: The boards are responsible for monitoring water quality and ensuring compliance with discharge standards. Violators can face penalties, including fines and imprisonment for non-compliance.
Pollution Prevention: Industries are required to treat their effluents to reduce harmful pollutants before discharging them into water bodies. The Act encourages the adoption of environmentally friendly technologies to minimize water pollution.
Citizenâ€™s Rights: The public is empowered to raise concerns or complaints about water pollution, and the Pollution Control Boards are tasked with addressing these grievances.
            <li><h2>2. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977</h2></li>
            <b>Objective:</b> This law supplements the Water Act by providing for the collection of a cess (tax) on water consumed by industries and local authorities to encourage water conservation and pollution control.<br>
            
             Cess Imposition: Industries that consume water are required to pay a cess, depending on the quantity of water they use. This includes industries such as thermal power plants, chemical industries, paper mills, and others that utilize large quantities of water.
             Incentives for Compliance: Industries that install and operate pollution control equipment are given rebates on the cess.
             Utilization of Cess: The funds collected from the cess are used to finance the Pollution Control Boards for carrying out water pollution prevention and control activities.
             <li><h2>3. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986</h2></li>
             <b>Objective:</b> Environment Protection Act was enacted in response to the Bhopal Gas Tragedy and provides a comprehensive framework for environmental protection, including water pollution control.<br>
             Regulatory Powers: The Central Government can take measures to regulate the discharge of pollutants into water bodies, control hazardous substances, and protect ecosystems from environmental degradation.
             Stringent Penalties: The act provides for harsher penalties than the Water Act for violations, including heavy fines and imprisonment for polluters.
             Pollution Standards: The Environment Act sets water quality standards and pollution limits for different types of industries and activities. It supplements the Water Act by providing broader powers for environmental protection.
             Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs): Industries and projects that may cause water pollution are required to conduct EIAs and obtain environmental clearances before proceeding with their activities.
             <li><h2>4. The Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification, 2011</h2></li>
             <b>Objective:</b> law regulates activities in the coastal areas to prevent pollution and protect coastal ecosystems.<br>
             Restriction on Industrial Activities: Industrial activities that could potentially pollute coastal waters are restricted within certain distances from the coastline.
             Prohibited Activities: The construction of new industries, discharge of untreated waste, and land reclamation activities in designated coastal areas are prohibited.
             Coastal Management Zones: The notification divides coastal areas into different zones, with varying levels of restrictions to safeguard water quality and prevent marine pollution.
             <li><h2>5. The National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act, 2010</h2></li>
             <b>Objective:</b> This act established the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a specialized body to handle disputes and enforcement of environmental laws, including water pollution control.<br>
             Quick Resolution: The NGT provides a platform for the speedy resolution of environmental disputes and ensures effective enforcement of water pollution laws.
             Power to Impose Penalties: The NGT has the authority to impose penalties and order compensations for damages caused by water pollution. Industries found violating pollution norms can be held accountable and directed to clean up polluted areas.
             Public Access: Citizens, activists, and organizations can approach the NGT to raise concerns or complaints about water pollution and other environmental issues.
             <li><h2>6. The Ganga Action Plan (GAP)</h2></li>
             <b>Objective:</b> Launched in 1986, the Ganga Action Plan aims to reduce pollution levels in the Ganga River by treating sewage and industrial effluents before they enter the river.<br>
             Sewage Treatment Plants: The plan involves constructing sewage treatment plants (STPs) in cities along the Ganga to treat municipal wastewater before it is discharged into the river.
             Effluent Treatment for Industries: Industries situated along the river are required to treat their effluents before releasing them into the river.
             Public Awareness and Participation: The plan encourages public participation in efforts to reduce pollution in the Ganga by raising awareness about water conservation and pollution control.
             <li><h2>7. The National Water Policy, 2012</h2></li>
             <b>Objective:</b> This policy outlines a framework for the sustainable management of water resources in India, focusing on pollution prevention, conservation, and equitable distribution.
             Prevention of Water Pollution: The policy emphasizes the need for effective implementation of laws like the Water Act to prevent the contamination of water bodies.
             Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM): The policy promotes a holistic approach to managing water resources, considering both the quantity and quality of water.
             Focus on Recycling and Reuse: Industries are encouraged to adopt practices such as water recycling and wastewater reuse to reduce pollution.
             <li><h2>8. The River Boards Act, 1956</h2></li>
             <b>Objective:</b> To provide for the establishment of river boards to regulate and develop interstate rivers and river valleys.<br>
                River Development: River boards, once established, are tasked with planning and implementing strategies to control river pollution, ensure proper utilization of river water, and prevent water disputes between states.
             Coordination Among States: The act facilitates cooperation among states to manage and protect interstate rivers, many of which face pollution issues.
             <li><h2>9. State-Level Water Laws</h2></li>
             In addition to national laws, several Indian states have their own laws and regulations to control water pollution. For example:
             Maharashtra Water Resources Regulatory Authority Act, 2005: Regulates the management and allocation of water resources in the state.
             Tamil Nadu Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Rules, 1983: Lays down state-specific rules for implementing the Water Act and controlling water pollution.
        </ul>
    </section>
</div>
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, remains the cornerstone law for preventing water pollution in India, supported by various other laws and policies. The act focuses on the prohibition of pollution discharge, monitoring of water quality, establishment of pollution control boards, and imposition of penalties for non-compliance. Other laws, such as the Environment Protection Act, 1986, the Water Cess Act, and state-specific rules, complement and strengthen water pollution control measures in the country. </p>
