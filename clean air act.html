<div class="container">
    <section class="intro">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Clean Air Act (CAA) was enacted in 1970 in the United States to control air pollution and improve air quality nationwide. The law has been amended several times to address new environmental challenges and ensure that the air remains safe to breathe.</p>

    <section class="history">
        <h2>History of the Clean Air Act</h2>
        <p>The Clean Air Act was first introduced in 1963, but it was the amendments of 1970 that significantly expanded its scope and enforcement power. The act established comprehensive federal and state regulations to limit emissions from both stationary and mobile sources of pollution.</p>
        <div class="law-highlight">
            <strong>Amendment (1990):</strong> This amendment introduced market-based principles like emissions trading to reduce air pollution cost-effectively.

    <section class="impact">
        <h2>Impact on Public Health and Environment</h2>
        <p>The Clean Air Act has led to substantial improvements in air quality. By reducing harmful pollutants, the act has helped prevent millions of cases of respiratory illnesses, cardiovascular diseases, and premature deaths.</p>
        <p>In addition, the act has improved visibility in national parks, reduced acid rain, and curbed damage to forests and aquatic ecosystems.</p>

         <b>Key Provisions:</b>
         Empowers the government to issue notifications and rules for managing air pollution.
         Allows for stringent measures against activities that harm the environment, including air pollution from industries and vehicles.
        <li><h2> 3.National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act, 2010</h2></li>
         <b>Objective:</b> Establishes a specialized tribunal to handle environmental disputes, including air pollution cases.<br>
         <b>Key Provisions:</b>
         Provides a platform for citizens and organizations to raise complaints regarding violations of environmental laws, including air quality issues.
         NGT rulings have played a significant role in addressing air pollution, especially in cities like Delhi.
         <li><h2>4. National Clean Air Programme (NCAP)</h2></li>
         <b>Objective:</b> A government initiative launched in 2019 to reduce air pollution across the country, particularly in urban areas.<br>
         <b>Key Provisions:</b>
         Aims to achieve a 20-30% reduction in particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations by 2024.
         Focuses on 122 cities that exceed safe air quality standards, implementing city-specific action plans.
         Measures include controlling emissions from vehicles, industries, and construction, along with promoting public awareness and alternative energy sources.
         <li><h2>5. Bharat Stage Emission Standards (BSES)</h2></li>
         <b>Objective: Regulates the emission standards for motor vehicles to control air pollution.</b>
         <b>Key Provisions:</b>
         Based on European standards, Bharat Stage standards (BS) set permissible emission limits for different vehicle types.
         Bharat Stage VI (BS6) standards, implemented in April 2020, aim to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter from vehicles by over 70% compared to the previous BS4 standards.
        <li><h2>6. Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP)</h2></li>
