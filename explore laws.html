        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Environmental laws are crucial in ensuring the protection of our natural resources. These laws regulate the use of natural resources, control pollution, and protect ecosystems.These laws protect ecosystems and biodiversity by regulating activities that could harm habitats, thereby preventing species from becoming endangered or extinct. Additionally, many environmental laws, like the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, focus on reducing pollution that directly impacts human health, helping to prevent respiratory illnesses, waterborne diseases, and exposure to harmful chemicals. Another critical aspect is climate change mitigation; environmental laws encourage the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and promote renewable energy sources, aligning with global efforts to combat climate change.</p>
