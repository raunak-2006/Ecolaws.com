        <h2>The Paris Agreement (2015)</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To combat climate change by limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit the increase to 1.5°C.</p>

<h2>Kyoto Protocol (1997)</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To reduce greenhouse gas emissions based on the premise that global warming exists and human-made CO₂ emissions have caused it.</p>

<h2>The Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (2000)</h2>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> To ensure the safe handling, transfer, and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from modern biotechnology, focusing on transboundary movements.</p>

<h2>Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer (1985)</h2>
