        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Endangered Species Act (ESA) is one of the most important environmental laws in the United States, enacted in 1973. Its goal is to protect and recover imperiled species and the ecosystems upon which they depend.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="history">
        <h2>History of the Endangered Species Act</h2>
        <p>The ESA was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in response to growing awareness of the extinction crisis. It replaced earlier conservation laws and broadened protections for species facing extinction.</p>
        <div class="law-highlight">
            <strong>Amendments (1978, 1982, 1988):</strong> These amendments provided more guidance on how to balance conservation and development activities.

        <h2>Impact on Wildlife and Environment</h2>
        <p>The ESA has been crucial in preventing the extinction of species like the bald eagle, American alligator, and gray wolf. By safeguarding habitats and creating recovery plans, the law has contributed to the long-term survival of many endangered and threatened species.</p>
        <p>The law also promotes biodiversity conservation, which is essential for ecosystem health and resilience in the face of environmental changes.</p>
